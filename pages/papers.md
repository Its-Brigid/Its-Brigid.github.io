## Simulated Regolith Testing of Origami-Based Covers for Space Robots
### Authors: Brigid Hickey, Ryan St. Pierre

>  A novel benchtop method is presented for eval-
uating abrasion-induced damage and particulate intrusion in
flexible, origami-based covers intended for planetary explo-
ration. Using a rock tumbler with silicon carbide grit as a
regolith simulant, this compact, repeatable setup simulates
continuous abrasion in a controlled laboratory environment.
The protocol enables rapid design iteration by accelerating
wear within a 24-hour cycle, making it well suited for early-
stage validation of protective structures. Weight measurements
and image-based tear analysis were used to assess regolith
accumulation and structural failure across cover designs with
3, 4, and 5 pleats. Results found using the proposed approach
showed that increased pleat count led to more frequent and
distributed tearing, particularly at fold intersections. However,
these tears generally reduced particulate accumulation, suggest-
ing a trade-off between flexibility and environmental protection.
The approach can be extended to other simulants, including
returned regolith, offering a scalable framework for qualifying
protective structures in space robotics.

#### Abstract
> Although wheeled robots have been predominant for planetary exploration, their geometry limits their capabilities when traveling over steep slopes, through rocky terrains, and in microgravity. Legged robots equipped with grippers are a viable alternative to overcome these obstacles. This paper proposes a gripping system that can provide legged space-explorer robots a reliable anchor on uneven rocky terrain. This gripper provides the benefits of soft gripping technology by using segmented tendon-driven fingers to adapt to the target shape, and creates a strong adhesion to rocky surfaces with the help of microspines. The gripping performances are showcased, and multiple experiments demonstrate the impact of the pulling angle, target shape, spine configuration, and actuation power on the performances. The results show that the proposed gripper can be a suitable solution for advanced space exploration, including climbing, lunar caves, or exploration of the surface of asteroids.
